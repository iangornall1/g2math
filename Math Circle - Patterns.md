Intro to Patterns:

\

- Pattern hunt (5 min):  Identify and draw patterns from around the room.  Think of how to describe them with numbers.

- Number Patterns (10 min)  - Dots, coins, poker chips or something.

    - Known Patterns: e.g. counting, even, odd, 2's, 5's, 10's

        - Rules (arithmetic)

    - Create and Trade

    - More complex patterns

        - Geometric patterns (multiplication)

        - Fibonacci Sequence - More complex rules => Geometric patterns

        - Triangular, Square

- Tesselations

- Sharing and Reflection 

    - **Everyday Patterns:** Can you identify patterns in your daily routine, like your bedtime routine or your school schedule? How do these patterns help you?

    - **Nature's Patterns:** How do patterns in nature, like the stripes on a tiger or the spirals on a sunflower, help animals and plants survive?

    - **Art and Design:** How do artists use patterns to create beautiful and interesting works of art? Can you think of any famous works of art that use patterns?

    - **Technology:** How are patterns used in technology, such as computer coding and digital design?

    - **Problem-Solving:** How can understanding patterns help you solve problems and make decisions? Can you think of a time when you used a pattern to solve a problem?
